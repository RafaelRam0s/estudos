    <h1>Testing then</h1>

    <p>I'm putting together a paragraph with a large text in Portuguese to see if this page will be tried to be translated into English. That's why I'm putting together a long text to see how Google's intelligence will work, because a page will use a hyperlink to the hreflang in English, but on this page, within the tagname html, the pt-br configuration is there, so there should be no reason for Google to request the translation.</p>

    <p>But I don't know how specifically the Google Translator translation recommendation works in Chrome, because some hypotheses have to be raised about it:</p>

    <p>Hypothesis 1: Google interprets most of the text contained on the website and then, based on its own decisions, defines which language it is in. I find it difficult that this mechanism really exists, bearing in mind that optimizing page loading would make the process slower</p>

    <p>Hypothesis 2: the attribute in the hreflang tagname would only work if the lang attribute is not defined within the html tagname</p>

    <p>Hypothesis 3: the attribute in the hreflang tagname advances the browsers' thinking process, thus skipping the step of verifying the lang within the html tagname</p>

    <p>Hypothesis 4: if the hreflang and the lang disagree with each other, the winner will be Google's tiebreaker criterion reading the site's text </p>

    <p>Hypothesis 5: if hreflang and lang disagree, Google just doesn't recommend a language for the site</p>
